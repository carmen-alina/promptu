## Contributing

This repo is structured as a monorepo: each directory in the root level of this repo should map to a component of Promptu and should be as self contained as possible. Each directory should be deployed as its own service.

As such, each component will have its own contributing guide, so to contribute, please first decide which component you need to contribute to, and navigate to that component's directory.
